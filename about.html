					<h4>What is a tech startup?</h4>
	    			<p>
	    				Paul Graham, co-founder of Y Combinator, describes startups as "companies designed to scale very quickly". These companies also operate "under conditions of extreme uncertainty", as Eric Ries, author of <i>The Lean Startup</i>, suggests. By our definition, a tech startup is a new company with both of these characteristics, and which can scale using technology. This definition would include companies that are producing a new software, a new drug or medical device, an end-to-end internet of things system, and so on. <!-- By contrast&mdash;though they may be new ventures&mdash;restaurants, consulting firms, medical practices, and other such companies would not fall within this definition. --> Because the level of uncertainty when launching these startups is so high, they generally requires different techniques and resources than other entrepreneurial ventures.

					<h4>Startup accelerators</h4>
	          		<p>
	          			As the name implies, accelerators are institutions designed to rapidly accelerate a startup company's growth. Generally speaking, accelerator programs last 3 to 4 months, and offer a number of invaluable resources during that time frame to aid in the startup's launch. Private accelerators&mdash;such as Y Combinator and TechStars&mdash;will invest a small amount of capital into a startup, but in return will take an equity stake in the company. Conversely, public accelerators, such as RED Labs, offer little-to-no investment, but also don't take an equity position in their participating startups.
